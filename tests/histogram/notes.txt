ASM command for C line: val = &(thread_arg->data[i]);
seems to be:

	mov	rax, QWORD PTR [rbp-40]	# tmp134, thread_arg
	mov	rdx, QWORD PTR [rax]	# D.4933, thread_arg_4->data
	mov	eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-44]	# tmp135, i
	cdqe
	add	rax, rdx	# tmp136, D.4933
	mov	QWORD PTR [rbp-8], rax	# val, tmp136

so look for this line: mov	QWORD PTR [rbp-8], rax
for approx SAS

this is for red, do same for blue and green:
